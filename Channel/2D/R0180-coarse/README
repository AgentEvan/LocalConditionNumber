The mesh number adopted here is nx*ny = 10*32

(optional) run "Test-FoamMatrix" first to obtain matrix coeffs data

run "python3 get_ConditionNumber.py" to 
obtain norm of each row of matrix inverse: rj_DD, rj_addBD, rj_Full
and
three different local condition number: Kj_DD, Kj_addBD, Kj_Full
in "./10000".

Check and tests in detail are written in "Post_2DChannel_0180_Coarse"
